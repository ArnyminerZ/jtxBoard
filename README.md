## Get the most out of journals, notes & tasks
Elevate the power of the ical-standard to the next level,
use the potential of the combination of journals, notes and tasks out of one app
and use DAVx5 to synchronize your entries with the server of your choice!

### iCal standard compliant
Using the iCal standard ensures compatibility and interoperability with other apps and services independent of a dedicated provider or infrastructure.

### Combine journals, notes & tasks
Instead of using separate apps for journals, notes & tasks you can use them out of one hand, combine and link them to each other, e.g. create meeting minutes and link your tasks to them. 

### Sync with DAVx5
Synchronize your entries with any compatible CalDAV server by using DAVx5 (https://www.davx5.com/). By using DAVx5 you are free to choose your preferred provider for CalDAV, you can even use your local server to store and synchronize your data.
